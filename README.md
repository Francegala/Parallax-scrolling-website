Website created using parallax effect as example for a flower shop


## Idea

The project started when I started to learn new techniques to use when designing a website.
I made some researches and since I found [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) really easy to use, I decided to study it and follow some tutorials online.

I focussed on the improvement of existing websites looking at the Italian website scene.
I was interested to upgrade the style and the view to create a great impact to customers using up to date technologies.

A great idea I came across with was using the Parallax effect. Bootstrap was giving me the ability to create a website which was responsible for both computers and mobile devices as well while the parallax effect was creating the right magic.

## Parallax effect

[Parallax scrolling is a web site trend where the background content (i.e. an image) is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling.

[Parallax scrolling is a technique in computer graphics where background images move past the camera more slowly than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth in a 2D scene and adding to the sense of immersion in the virtual experience.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_scrolling)

The parallax effect has been created using floral images creating consistency with the theme of the website using free images as examples.

## Flower shop

The template I created has the theme of a flower shop but using some random content as text (Lorem Ipsum) and some logos and images I created using free photos and common shapes.
I expected a new style for a web presentation to give a good visual and graphic impact to a simple and classic shop. I designed a single landing page in order not to divert the attention of the customers underlying the topic and the main themes.
This version shows what the fictitious shop has to offer creating a virtual tour of the company scrolling through the content, words and pics.
Obviously the content is all made up by me and the hyperlinks are all linked to other pages of my website and in case of a real website for a client, the content will be aimed to the right necessity and requirement.
A single page website with the content readable only if wished to do is planned to give the user control of the various parts of the page without the need to change page, to load content and without the waste of time of redirecting, knowing where to look for an element and clicking in wrong sections. I thought that a modern website needs to reduce the number of clicks the user performs.

The website is intended to be customizable.
